            <p>
                I'm Jordan and welcome to my website! If you've made it this far,

                and check out some of the stuff I've done. Enjoy!

            <p>
                I'm a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
                A lot of people ask me what Systems Design is, and to be honest I don't really know.
                The way I see it, it is a multidisciplinary approach to engineering.
                Engineering encompasses a wide variety of fields, with each field working on a specific part of a project.
                Systems Design (I think) is supposed to be the glue that binds these fields and parts together to... well... design a system.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a developer, with the hopes of one day becoming a software engineer.
                I love to learn things that will help me achieve this, whether that may be languages, frameworks,
                algorithms, or even things that seemingly have no relation whatsoever but might help me learn to think better.
                I hope to go to bed at night having learned at least one new thing that day.
                For me, it's not about what I know, it's about what I don't.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not at school or on a co-op, I enjoy music, books, tennis, video games, pi√±a coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
                I've been a piano player as long as I can remember, so hit me up if you're forming a rock band.
                While most of these hobbies are just for fun, one thing I take very seriously is building Lego.
                If you think you can out-build me, I want to meet you. Check below for my email.
