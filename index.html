        <h2>Hi,</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Jordan and welcome to my website! If you've made it this far,
          you might as well read on below to learn a bit about me, have a look at my resume,
          and check out some of the stuff I've done.

        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
          A lot of people ask me what Systems Design is, and to be honest I don't really know.
          The way I see it, it is a multidisciplinary approach to engineering.
          Engineering encompasses a wide variety of fields, with each field working on a specific part of a project.
          Systems Design (I think) is supposed to be the glue that binds these fields and parts together to... well... design a system.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a developer, and have worked several terms as a software engineering intern.
          I love to learn things that will help me become a better engineer, whether that may be languages, frameworks,
          algorithms, or even things that seemingly have no relation whatsoever but might help me learn to think better.
          I hope to go to bed each night having learned at least one new thing that day.
          For me, it's not about what I know, it's about what I don't.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not at school or on a co-op, I enjoy music, books, tennis, video games, pi√±a coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
          I've been a piano player as long as I can remember, so hit me up if you're forming a rock band.
          While most of these hobbies are just for fun, one thing I take very seriously is building Lego.
          If you think you can out-build me, I want to meet you. Check below for my email.
